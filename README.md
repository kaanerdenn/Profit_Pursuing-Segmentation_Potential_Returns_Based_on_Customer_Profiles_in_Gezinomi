This documentation summarizes the data analysis tasks performed using Python and the Pandas library.

## Task 1: Data Loading and Overview

We started by loading the data from an Excel file named 'gezinomi.xlsx' and configuring Pandas display options for better data visualization.

## Task 2: Unique Cities and Their Frequencies

We determined the number of unique cities in the dataset and their respective frequencies.

## Task 3: Unique Concepts

We found the number of unique concepts present in the dataset.

## Task 4: Sales by Concept

We counted the number of sales for each concept.

## Task 5: Total Earnings by Cities

We calculated the total earnings from sales for each city.

## Task 6: Earnings by Concept Types

We calculated the total earnings for each concept type.

## Task 7: Price Averages by City

We computed the average prices by city.

## Task 8: Price Averages by Concepts

We determined the average prices by concept.

## Task 9: Price Averages in City-Concept Breakdown

We found the average prices in the breakdown of city-concept combinations.

## Task 10: Creating a New Variable (EB_Score)

We defined a new variable called 'EB_Score' based on specific criteria and added it to the dataset. Additionally, we exported the first 50 rows to an Excel file named 'eb_scorew.xlsx'.

## Task 11: Segmentation and Analysis

We performed segmentation and analysis of personas by creating segments based on price.

## Task 12: Finding a Specific Segment

We found the segment for a specific city-concept combination, "ANTALYA_HERÅžEY DAHIL_HIGH," and determined the expected price.
